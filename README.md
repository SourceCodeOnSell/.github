Get your own custom made Telegram Bot. Inbox any developer from below list with your Bot idea and discuss about the cost for making that Bot. Please inbox only one developer from below list. If we find that you are asking all developers to make same kind of bot then they all will block you. Also don't force the developers if they are not interested to make your bot. This may also cause block.
